Finally, in terms of the original graph, by adding $I$ to $\\alpha(A \\odot A)$, we are adding exactly $d$ edges to the original edge set: one self-loop at each node.

Therefore, $W = I + D_{DAG}$ iff $A$ is a $DAG$, where the $DAG$ $D_{DAG} = \\alpha(A \\odot A)$. $W$ itself is clearly not a $DAG$; that each node has a self-loop precludes this. \n",

To see why this is the case, suppose to the contrary that there is a cycle starting and ending at $n$ that traverses at least one non-self-loop edge. Then, because $I$ does not add any edges *between* nodes to $D_DAG$, the cycle must be relying on one or more edges from $D_DAG$ to eventually return to $n$. Furthermore, in this scenario, the path would still constitute a cycle from $n$ to $n$ if any self-loop traversals were removed since self-loop traversals do not change the active node on a path. This would mean the supposed path is (or has a subset that contains) a cycle that depends exclusively on edges from $D_DAG$. But we know $D_DAG$ is a $DAG$, and that such a path cannot exist. We have reached a contradiction. As a result, there can be no cycle of length $l$ that is not composed of $l$ traversals of a node's self-loop. Because each node in $W$ has just one self-loop edge due to $I$, this also means there are $d$ total cycles of length $l$ in W - one for each node.\n",

If $l = d$, it is obvious that both $c$ and the full self-loop cycle for $n$ induced by $I$ would be included in ${W^d}_{kk}$, meaning ${W^d}_{kk} > 1$ and $\\operatorname{tr}(W^d) > d$. If $l < d$, one could add $d-l$ self-loop traversals to the cycle $c$ to increase its length, increment ${W^d}_{kk}$, and cause $\\operatorname{tr}(W^d) > d$.
